## The Pain about Python

The real pain about Python is sometimes indentation gets in the way of life.

Here is a annoying code example that will give you errors.

```
def bleh():
  print("function executed")
  
  
bleh()
```
Here we added a few extra (indented) lines. It wil give us an error.

But with the useless nothing library, we can fill in this!


```
def bleh():
  print("function executed")
  nothing()
  nothing()
bleh()
```

The whole reason this is 'useless' is you could do this like so:

```
def bleh():
  print("function executed")
  #
  #
  #
bleh()
```

So this library is pretty much just an extra dependancy to annoy everybody and waste network bandwidth downloading.

The whole idea of this library was pretty much a joke but there was one time I insanly thought it would actually be pretty practical.

## Read these before adding to your ridiculously long list of dependancies.
